# Industrial Copper Modeling
### Problem defnition

The copper industry faces challenges with sales and pricing data due to skewness and noise. Manual predictions are hindered, and a machine learning regression model is suggested, using techniques like normalization and outlier detection for accurate pricing decisions.

Lead capture is another issue. A lead classification model is proposed, using "WON" and "LOST" statuses to evaluate and categorize potential customers, streamlining the conversion process.

## Project Aproach
#### Data Understanding
Identify variable types: Continuous (numeric) and Categorical (categories).
Handle '00000' values in 'Material_Reference' by converting them to null.
Treat reference columns as categorical variables.
Consider removing uninformative variable 'INDEX'.
#### Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values using mean/median/mode for numeric columns.
Identify and treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest.
Address skewness in continuous variables with appropriate transformations.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot, label, or ordinal encoding.
#### EDA
Visualize outliers with box plots before and after treatment.
Visualize skewness with distplots or histograms.
#### Feature Engineering
Create new features by aggregating existing ones.
Transform variables for more informative representations.
Drop highly correlated columns using a heatmap.
